    "maintenanceInfoWhy": "為甚麼這會發生？",
    "maintenanceInfoWhyText": "在過去的幾個月裡，我們在後台徹底改進了 Habitica。特別的是我們重新寫了 API。雖然在前台可能看起來沒有什麼改變，在後台它已經是一個全新的世界。這將使我們在未來想要寫一個新功能的時候，有更大的彈性，並且帶來更好的表現！",

    "maintenanceInfoAddFeaturesText": "Completing this rewrite will allow us to start building out improved chat and Guilds, plans for organizations and families, and additional productivity features like Monthlies and the ability to record yesterday’s activity! Those are all involved features on their own, so it will take time to build them, but until we were finished with this rewrite, there was no way we could start them.",
    "maintenanceInfoHowLong": "維護會持續多久？",
    "maintenanceInfoHowLongText": "We have to migrate tasks and data for all 1.3 million Habitica users -- not an easy task! We anticipate that it will take place between approximately 1pm Pacific Time (8pm UTC) and 10pm Pacific Time (5am UTC). Rest assured that we’re doing everything we can to make it go as quickly as possible! You can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'>updates on our Twitter</a>.",
    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffected": "How will my Dailies, Streaks, Buffs, and Quests be affected?",
    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText1": "You will NOT take any damage or lose any streaks that weekend, but otherwise, your day will reset normally! Dailies that you checked will become unchecked, buffs will reset, etc. If you are in a Collection Quest, you will still find items. If you are in a Boss Battle, you will still deal damage to the Boss, but the Boss will not deal damage to you. (Even monsters need a break!)",
    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText2": "After a lot of thought, our team concluded that this was the most fair way to handle the fact that many users will not be able to check off their Dailies normally during the maintenance. We’re sorry for any inconvenience this causes!",
    "maintenanceInfoSeeTasks": "如果我需要查看我的任務呢？",
    "maintenanceInfoSeeTasksText": "If you know that you will need to see your task list on Saturday to remind yourself what you have to do, we recommend that before the maintenance begins, you take a screenshot of your tasks so that you can use it as a reference.",
    "maintenanceInfoRarePet": "我會受到什麼樣的稀有寵物？",
    "maintenanceInfoRarePetText": "To thank you for your patience during the downtime, everyone will get a rare Veteran Pet. If you’ve never received a Veteran Pet before, you will receive a Veteran Wolf. If you already have a Veteran Wolf, you will receive a Veteran Tiger. And if you already have a Veteran Wolf and a Veteran Tiger, you will receive a never-before-seen Veteran pet! After the migration is completed, it may take several hours for your pet to show up, but never fear, everyone will get one.",
    "maintenanceInfoWho": "是誰曾參與了這超大的工程?",
    "maintenanceInfoWhoText": "We’re glad you asked! It was spearheaded by our amazing contributor paglias, with lots of help from Blade, TheHollidayInn, SabreCat, Victor Pudeyev, TheUnknown, and Alys.",
    "maintenanceInfoTesting": "The new version was also tirelessly tested by a bunch of our amazing open-source volunteers. Thank you -- we couldn't have done this without you."
